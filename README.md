# Spring Boot 2 and Assert with JUnit5 and Mockito

With the recent release of Spring 2.2.0, it is now loaded with JUnit5. 
What I personally like with this version is the transition to Java 8, which means Lambda expressions are now supported. 
And it doesnâ€™t hurt to update as JUnit5 is backward compatible. That means that old tests will still run and update can be gradual.
